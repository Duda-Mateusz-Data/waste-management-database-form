🏗 Background / Motivation

This project was created to digitize the waste collection system, which was previously recorded manually on paper 📝. It serves as a waste tracking and reporting system for residents submitting waste to a selective waste collection point (PSZOK). The goal is to automate record-keeping, streamline reporting, monitor limits, and reduce repeated violations ⚡.

Before this system, the paper-based process was inefficient and prone to errors ❌. Key issues included:

🛑 Difficulty enforcing limits: Exceeding limits was often ignored, and tracking violators was slow.

📄 High paper usage & slow processing: Manual record-keeping was time-consuming and error-prone.

🔍 Inefficient data retrieval: Searching past submissions by resident or address was cumbersome.

With this system:

👨‍💼 Municipal employees can quickly identify residents exceeding waste limits, which may result in financial penalties 💰.

🔒 Waste submissions are anonymized for general use, while municipal staff has controlled access to detailed records.

🧮 Automatic calculations, conditional formatting, and search functionality allow efficient monitoring of yearly limits and help manage waste collection costs.

📊 Historical data and reporting capabilities provide insights into the origins and volumes of waste, helping the municipality optimize resource allocation.

Through creating this project, I gained significant experience in Google Apps Script and Google Sheets integration ⚙️, designing dynamic and user-friendly forms 🖥️, managing structured data 🗂️, and implementing real-time validations ✅.

The system evolved over time with additional features:

📚 Dictionaries for waste types

➕ Multiple waste entry rows

🔎 Search by address

These improvements greatly enhanced efficiency and usability, making the system suitable not only for daily operations but also for reporting and monitoring waste limits throughout the year.
