🏗 Background / Motivation

This project was created to digitize the waste collection system, which was previously recorded manually on paper 📝. It serves as a waste tracking and reporting system for residents submitting waste to a selective waste collection point (PSZOK).

Goal: ⚡

Automate record-keeping

Streamline reporting

Monitor limits

Reduce repeated violations

❌ Problems with the previous system

Before this project, the paper-based process was inefficient and prone to errors:

🛑 Difficulty enforcing limits – Exceeding limits was often ignored, and tracking violators was slow.

📄 High paper usage & slow processing – Manual record-keeping was time-consuming and error-prone.

🔍 Inefficient data retrieval – Searching past submissions by resident or address was cumbersome.

✅ How this system helps

👨‍💼 Municipal employees can quickly identify residents exceeding waste limits, which may result in financial penalties 💰.

🔒 Waste submissions are anonymized for general use, while municipal staff has controlled access to detailed records.

🧮 Automatic calculations, conditional formatting, and search functionality allow efficient monitoring of yearly limits.

📊 Historical data and reporting capabilities provide insights into the origins and volumes of waste, helping the municipality optimize resources and costs.

🛠 Skills & Learnings

Through creating this project, I gained experience in:

⚙️ Google Apps Script & Google Sheets integration

🗂️ Managing structured and anonymized data

✅ Implementing real-time validations and limit checks

✨ Key Features Added Over Time

📚 Dictionaries for waste types and units

➕ Multiple waste entry rows per submission

🔎 Search by address to check yearly limits

🖌️ Conditional formatting highlighting limit exceedances

💡 Impact: The system replaced inefficient paper-based logs, reduced errors, improved limit enforcement, and enabled reporting and analysis of waste collection trends.
